                <p>CSS is a language for specifying how documents are presented to users — how they are styled,
             laid out, etc.</p>
    <p>A document is usually a text file structured using a markup language — HTML is the most common markup 
        language, but you will also come across other markup languages such as SVG or XML.</p> 
    <p>Presenting a document to a user means converting it into a usable form for your audience. 
        Browsers, like Firefox, Chrome or Internet Explorer, are designed to present documents visually, 
        for example, on a computer screen, projector or printer.</p> 
                <li></li>

        <section class="main-section" id="Background"> 
            <header><h2>Background</h2></header>
            <article>
                <p>"In CSS2.1 the"<code>background</code> "shorthand property included 5 longhand values" – 
        <code>background-color</code>"," <code>background-image</code>"," <code>background-repeat</code>"," 
        <code>background-attachment</code>"," and <code>background-position</code>"." "In CSS3 and beyond, 
        it now includes three more, for a total of up to 8. Here’s how the values map:"</p> 
    </article> <code class="css-language">background: [background-color], [background-image], 
        [background-repeat], [background-attachment],[background-position];</code> 
    <p>Notice the forward slash, similar to how <code>font</code> shorthand and <b>border-radius</b> 
        can be written. The slash allows you to include a 
        <code>background-size</code> value after the position in supporting browsers.</p>
   <p>In addition, you also have up to two optional declarations for <code>background-origin</code> and 
    <code>background-clip</code>.</p>
   <p>So the syntax looks like this:</p>
   <code class="css-language"> .example { background: aquamarine url(img.png) 
    <span> no-repeat</span> 
    <span>scroll</span>
     <span>center center / 50%</span> 
     <span>content-box content-box;</span>}</code> </section> 
        <section class="main-section" id="Border">
           <header><h2>Border</h2></header>
            <article> <p>The <b>border</b> shorthand CSS property sets an element's border. It sets the values of 
            <code>border-width</code>, <code>border-style</code>, and <code>border-color</code>.</p> </article>

        <section class="main-section" id="Link">
            <header><h2>Link</h2></header>
            <article> <p> Link is a connection from one web page to another web pages. 
                    CSS property can be used to style the links in various different ways.</p>
                    <p>States of Link: Before discussing CSS properties, it is important to know the 
                        states of a link. Links can exist in different states and they can be styled using 
                        pseudo classes.</p> 
                    <p>There are four state of links given below:</p> 
                    <ul> <li><b>a:link</b> => This is a normal, unvisited link.</li>
                        <li><b>a:visited</b> => This is a link visited by user at least once.</li>
                        <li><b>a:hover</b> => This is a link when mouse hovers over it.</li>
                        <li><b>a:active</b> => This is a link which is just clicked.</li>
                        <p><strong>Syntax:</strong></p>
                        <code class="css-language"> a:link {color: color_name;}</code>

        <section class="main-section" id="Responsive">
    <header><h2>Responsive</h2></header>
            <article> <p> Responsive design refers to a site or application design that 
                                responds to the environment in which it is viewed. It encompasses a number of 
                                CSS and HTML features and techniques and is now essentially just how we 
                                build websites by default. </p> 
                                <p> Consider the sites that you visit on your phone — it is probably fairly 
                                    unusual to come across a site that is the desktop version scaled down, 
                                    or where you need to scroll sideways to find things. This is because 
                                    the web has moved to this approach of designing responsively. </p>
